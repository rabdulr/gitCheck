# gitCheck

gitCheck is an application that enables instructors to gauge engagement through student commits of forked projects.

## About the Project

Gauging engagement for a remote class can be difficult. There is only so much information that can be gained from projects and classes themselves. I designed this application
out of the desire to see how students are tackling projects by grabbing commit information from GitHub and and aggregating commits. This is a project that has challenged me in
its design and application.

## Current State

This project is still a work in progress and has not yet been deployed.

## Built With

This is a React project utilizing many different components.
* [React] (https://reactjs.org)
* [React-Router] (https://reactrouter.com)
* [React-Bootstrap] (https://react-bootstrap.netlify.app)
* [Express] (http://expressjs.com)
* [Node] (https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Getting Started

for your application.
