# gitCheck

[gitCheck](https://red-gitcheck.herokuapp.com/) is an application that enables instructors to gauge engagement through student commits of forked projects.

## About the Project

Gauging engagement for a remote class can be difficult. There is only so much information that can be gained from projects and classes themselves. I designed this application
out of the desire to see how students are tackling projects by grabbing commit information from GitHub and and aggregating commits.
